        "1.  **Optimize Mobile Experience**: Given the significantly lower conversion rate on mobile (3.09%) compared to desktop (8.50%), a high priority should be placed on optimizing the mobile user experience. This could involve improving mobile site speed, simplifying navigation, enhancing product imagery, and streamlining the checkout process specifically for mobile devices.\n",
        "2.  **Investigate Mobile Drop-off Points**: Conduct a detailed analysis of the mobile user journey to identify specific pain points or pages where users are dropping off. Tools like heatmaps, session recordings, and mobile-specific analytics can help pinpoint these issues.\n",
        "3.  **Targeted A/B Testing for Mobile**: Implement A/B tests on mobile-specific design changes, call-to-action placements, and checkout flow improvements to iteratively boost conversion rates for mobile users.\n",
        "4.  **Consider Device-Specific Marketing Strategies**: Tailor marketing campaigns and ad creatives to emphasize the strengths of each device type. For instance, campaigns aimed at mobile users might focus on convenience or quick purchases, while desktop campaigns could highlight detailed product information."

        "    *   **Statistical Significance:** A two-sample proportion z-test resulted in a p-value of 0.0000.

This could involve improving site speed, simplifying navigation, and streamlining the checkout process specifically for mobile devices to boost conversions.\n",
        "*   **Leverage Returning Customer Value:** While the AOV difference is statistically significant, it's not a large absolute difference ($60.54 vs. $59.86). Future strategies could explore how to further increase the AOV for returning customers through personalized recommendations, loyalty programs, or exclusive offers that encourage larger purchases.\n"

        "The primary objective of this hackathon, as outlined in the \"Toy Store Hackathon Brief.pdf,\" was to analyze the Toy Store E-Commerce dataset to identify actionable business insights. Participants were tasked with formulating a business hypothesis, translating it into statistical hypotheses, testing it using the provided datasets (sessions, pageviews, orders, returns), and making data-driven recommendations. The focus areas included marketing channels, conversions, customer segments, order amounts, and returns.\n",

        "**Business Hypothesis:** Sessions originating from 'gsearch' (Google Search) will exhibit a higher conversion rate to orders compared to sessions originating from 'bsearch' (Bing Search), or more broadly, 'paid' channels will have a higher conversion rate than 'other' channels.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Statistical Hypotheses:**\n",

        "\n",
        "**Analysis Steps:**\n",
        "1.  The `website_sessions` and `orders` DataFrames were loaded, and their `created_at` columns were converted to datetime objects.\n",
        "2.  The `website_sessions_df` was merged with `orders_df` (specifically `order_id`) using a left merge on `website_session_id` to link sessions to orders.\n",
        "3.  A new `converted` column was created, set to 1 if an `order_id` was present (indicating a conversion) and 0 otherwise.\n",
        "4.  A `marketing_channel_type` column was introduced: sessions with `utm_source` as 'gsearch' or 'bsearch', or missing `utm_source` but `http_referer` containing 'gsearch.com', were categorized as 'paid'. All other sessions were categorized as 'other'.\n",
        "5.  Descriptive statistics and conversion rates (`count`, `sum`, `mean`) were calculated for the `converted` column, grouped by `marketing_channel_type`.\n",
        "6.  A bar plot visualized the distribution of marketing channel types.\n",
        "7.  A bar plot displayed the conversion rates for 'paid' vs. 'other' channels.\n",
        "8.  A two-sample proportion z-test was conducted to statistically compare the conversion rates, using `alternative='larger'` based on H₁.\n",

        "*   **Observed Conversion Rates:**\n",
        "    *   'Paid' channels: 414,060 sessions, 28,371 conversions, **Conversion Rate = 6.85%**.\n",
        "    *   'Other' channels: 58,811 sessions, 3,942 conversions, **Conversion Rate = 6.70%**.\n",
        "*   **Statistical Significance:** The two-sample proportion z-test yielded a z-statistic of 1.3408 and a **p-value of 0.0900**. Since this p-value (0.0900) was greater than the significance level (α = 0.05), we failed to reject the Null Hypothesis. This indicates that there was no statistically significant evidence to conclude that paid marketing channels lead to a higher conversion rate compared to other marketing channels based on the provided data.\n",

Participants were tasked with formulating a business hypothesis, translating it into statistical hypotheses, testing it using the provided datasets (sessions, pageviews, orders, returns), and making data-driven recommendations. The focus areas included marketing channels, conversions, customer segments, order amounts, and returns.\n",
